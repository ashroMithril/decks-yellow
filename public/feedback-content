Redefining Latency Standards and Adaptation Rashid Khan suggested removing "proprietary" from "redefining latency standards" and focusing on "voice to voice LLM for sub-second latency or sub 500 millseconds latency". They highlighted that the adaptation capability of Nex is a more compelling feature than latency alone, noting an example where Nex generated combined language responses, which was very good to see. Rashid Khan recommended focusing on adaptation as a good keyword because it showcases what the product can do now that it couldn't do earlier (00:00:47).
Roadmap and Product Positioning Apoorva Shrivastava planned to replace the third block of their vision slide with "nexus" and retain "agentic discovery" (00:00:47). Rashid Khan cautioned against listing Nex in the roadmap for a presentation to Maxall, asserting that anything mentioned as being in beta or on the roadmap will be discounted by them (00:01:31). They agreed to remove Nex from the roadmap and instead place it in the vision slides or a separate slide to present it as already ready (00:02:22).
Proprietary LLMs and Key Product Terms The discussion confirmed that "komodo" and "yellow" are proprietary LLMs and should be used in the deck. Apoorva Shrivastava agreed to replace "discovery" with "Nexus" in relevant slides, potentially using the terms "nexus discovery" or "nexus discover" (00:02:22).
Investment and Partnerships Rashid Khan suggested increasing the displayed investment percentage from 18% to around 26% or 27% of revenue to show high investment. Apoorva Shrivastava noted three types of partners: deployment partners, DCS technology, and vertical resellers like innovaser and simpler (00:03:12). Rashid Khan recommended adding telco accelerators and big telcos to the technology partners section for broader distribution, especially for the voice-to-voice offering (00:04:14).
Pricing Strategy Rashid Khan advised Apoorva Shrivastava to tell Maxall that they offer two pricing modes: a base platform fee, and the option for customers to choose between a usage-based fee (consumption-driven) or an outcome-based fee. The percentages of revenue for pricing models should be removed (00:05:08). Outcome-based fees are typically higher and require due diligence (00:06:06).
Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Distribution Channels Rashid Khan discussed offering a PLG-led model where customers can start with a low monthly fee ($499 per month) and scale gradually, offering flexibility in how they purchase. They also emphasized adding big distributor channels in the US, such as Avant and TSDs, to the partnerships, as much of the contact center is sold through channels (00:06:54).
Deployment Timelines and Partner Deployment Rashid Khan suggested reducing the complex deployment timeline from four to eight weeks to perhaps three to six or two to five weeks, especially when showcasing the Nexus agent building use case (00:07:53). They also agreed to remove the 12% figure associated with partner deployments (00:08:44).
Blended Pod Model and Customer Success Rashid Khan recommended explaining the "blended pod model," where customer success is always owned by yellow, and forward-deployed engineers (FDEs), who may come from yellow or partners, work on multiple customers (00:08:44). They emphasized that the end relationship in this AI world is what yellow is trying to own (00:09:32).
Demonstrations and Multimodality Apoorva Shrivastava detailed the demonstration plan, including three demos, some pre-recorded, covering multimodal and application resource allocation and management in IT use cases. The demos will include one on the same HP demo shown at Gartner and applications in ITSM use cases, such as installing or monitoring applications or password reset (00:10:29).
Explaining Agentic Framework Apoorva Shrivastava expressed concern that the term "agentic" might be debated. Rashid Khan suggested showcasing the agentic aspect through features like analysis and the build function, where the system figures things out itself without being explicitly told the logic or scaffolding (00:11:45).
Resource Orchestration and Execution To address the complex task execution and state management questions, Rashid Khan advised discussing two main points: the execution planning planner which includes defining guard rails and recovery paths for edge cases, and storing user conversation context in the customer 360 user 360 for retrieval via the MCP tool call (00:13:41). They also suggested mentioning the RAG architecture for knowledge retrieval and the user graph for long-term memory (00:14:50).
Pre-built Components and Integrations The need for a marketplace of pre-built agents has diminished due to Nex's ability to create them in seconds via prompting. Rashid Khan proposed that they instead focus on pre-built integration templates, as building integration is a critical aspect, and that the platform works well with orchestration platforms like N8N or Zapier to open up to over a thousand integrations (00:16:51). Apoorva Shrivastava confirmed that customers can configure any MCP and that two are currently listed: Post case and HubSpot (00:18:32).
Application Testing Tools Rashid Khan emphasized stressing the application testing tool as a big differentiator, including the "gym simulation environment" (00:18:32). They suggested highlighting that the framework allows defining personas and use cases to automatically generate conversations for testing, which then provides results and suggestions for fixing issues (00:19:21). Nexus will also be added to this section for its capability to operate on use cases or test the bot against unresolved conversations (00:20:13).
Security, Guardrails, and Certifications Apoorva Shrivastava noted that they have their own guardrails and allow enterprises to implement their own rules. Rashid Khan added that they should list all relevant certifications, such as the ISO certifications, including the recent ones (00:21:17).
Human Plus AI Interactions and Handoffs Handoffs are supported on voice and chat channels, passing on summaries and key actions on both their platform and third-party systems (00:21:17). Rashid Khan proposed showcasing the power of Nexus for first-class support on yellow's platform, including its ability to utilize page context, user context, and respond to agents' questions within an inbox conversation (00:22:11).
Legacy System Integration Rashid Khan identified that questions on legacy system integration specifically refer to systems without modern APIs, such as older SAP or systems built on COBOL (00:24:58). They outlined a module called "yellow legacy" which is a custom-built, on-premise deployment that acts as a bridge, integrating with access and authorization management systems to perform database executions and procedure calls, providing an API gateway to yellow's agent (00:25:44).
Voice and Telephone Support Apoorva Shrivastava plans to use a diagram and answers provided by Shellis to explain the telephone structure and architecture. The presentation will address platform connectivity, voice quality differentiation (including the adaptation bit), and technology used for speech enablement (00:27:43). Rashid Khan pointed out the need to mention voice streaming and to clarify with Abilash how bidirectional encryption secures voice communication (00:28:50).
Knowledge Management and Multilingual Support The plan is to present a complete life cycle of knowledge management, including ingesting knowledge from all formats, scheduling, and syncing with systems like ServiceNow and SAP, with Nexus querying and improving it (00:30:04). For multilingual support, the team will mention 35+ languages, the voice-to-voice architecture handling language switching at the LLM level, and the use of LLMs, native translation capabilities, language-specific models (like Komodo for Bahasa), and third-party engines like Google and Microsoft Translate (00:31:35).
Deck Review and Deployment Environment Apoorva Shrivastava noted that the strategy and platform architecture sections, totaling about 60 minutes, will likely lead to many questions during the demo (00:33:55). Rashid Khan planned a review session for 8:30 PM to ensure the deck is ready. They stressed the importance of not showing the beta link for the demo; Apoorva Shrivastava should ensure the latest version is deployed to the cloud for the demo to avoid Maxall grilling them (00:23:03) (00:45:51).
Use of Gemini and Cursors for Deck Creation Apoorva Shrivastava mentioned using Gemini to take notes and create a cursor repository with all the answers, which was then used to generate a presentation deck (00:15:48) (00:41:42). Rashid Khan acknowledged that the tool is amazing and suggested they can beautify the deck (00:42:33). They discussed moving to a black and white theme and experimenting with different UI elements for the slides (00:43:29).
